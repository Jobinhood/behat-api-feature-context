# behat-api-feature-context
Behat context file for testing JSON-based API's. This file is an adaption of [Ryan Weaver](https://twitter.com/weaverryan) his adaptation of the [feature context file](https://github.com/philsturgeon/build-apis-you-wont-hate/blob/master/chapter12/app/tests/behat/features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php) written by [Phil Sturgeon](https://twitter.com/philsturgeon) and [Ben Corlett](https://twitter.com/ben_corlett).

I just rewrote the file to be compatible with the latest versions (as of Oct 16, 2016) of Behat 3.2, Guzzle 6.2 and PHPUnit 5.6.

#WARNING
Most of these functions are not tested yet. I will be using this file for my projects and fix bugs as I encounter them. Be aware of this :)

If you notice any problems, please create a new issue [here](https://github.com/thejager/behat-api-feature-context/issues/new) or if you would like to fix it yourself and create a pull request. :)
